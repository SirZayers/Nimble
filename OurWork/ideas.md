# Project Ideas

* Finalize C++ endorser
* Integrate into something else than Hadoop (SQL, Filesystem, ???, maybe something faster?)
* Automatically initialize new endorsers before majority runs out (I think this is in the coordiantor)
* Limit the number of endorsers running at one point
* Logging
* Build a client that actually allows appending and reading some data
